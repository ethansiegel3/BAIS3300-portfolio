    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: December 8, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>[Your Company Name]</strong> ("we", "us", "our"). Protecting your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and store information when you visit <a href="https://www.example.com">https://www.example.com</a> (the "Site") or otherwise interact with us.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <li><strong>Usage information:</strong> pages you visit, time spent on pages, referral source, device and browser information, IP address, and similar technical data collected through server logs and analytics tools.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies and tracking:</strong> cookies, local storage, and similar technologies (see <em>Cookies</em> section below).</li>
      <li><strong>Content you provide:</strong> comments, form submissions, uploaded files, and other material you choose to send us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use information for purposes including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving the Site and our services.</li>
      <li>Responding to your questions, requests, or support inquiries.</li>
      <li>Sending administrative messages, updates, and promotional communications (when you consent or where permitted by law).</li>
      <li>Analyzing usage trends and measuring the effectiveness of content and features.</li>
      <li>Detecting, preventing, and addressing technical issues or fraud.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We and our third-party service providers use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect usage information. Cookies are small text files stored on your device. You can control cookies through your browser settings — for details, see <a href="cookies.html">our Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services (such as analytics providers, hosting services, payment processors, and email delivery services) that collect, store, or analyze information on our behalf. These providers have their own privacy policies; we encourage you to review them. The Site may also contain links to other websites; we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites.</p>

    <h2>5. Analytics</h2>
    <p>We may use analytics tools (for example, Google Analytics or similar) to understand how visitors use the Site. These tools collect technical data (e.g., IP address, device type) and usage data. Where available, we rely on the analytics provider's mechanisms for controlling data retention and anonymization (for example, IP masking).</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law. When we no longer need personal information, we will securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Correction:</strong> request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> request deletion of your personal information (subject to limitations and legal obligations).</li>
      <li><strong>Objection / Restriction:</strong> object to or request restriction of certain processing activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> request a portable copy of data we hold about you, where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at the address below. We may need to verify your identity before acting on requests.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Site is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or higher minimum age where required). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us so we can take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>If you are located outside the country where our servers are located, your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in another country where data protection laws may differ. We take appropriate steps to protect personal information during such transfers.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
